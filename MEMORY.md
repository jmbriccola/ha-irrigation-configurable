# Project Memory — Irrigation Maestro

Decision log and progress record for the `irrigation_maestro` Home Assistant
custom integration. Everything decided or done in this project is recorded
here (project rule).

## Identity

- **Name**: Irrigation Maestro — **domain `irrigation_maestro`**.
  Collision check (2026-07-17): domain is free in home-assistant/brands
  (4 248 custom + 1 492 core brands checked), HACS default list (2 698 repos),
  HA core components, GitHub-wide code search. Nearby names: `maestro_mcz`
  (stoves), `bluemaestro` (BLE), irrigation-related domains
  `irrigation_unlimited`, `irrigationprogram`, `smart_irrigation`,
  `simple_irrigation`, `opensprinkler`, `irrigation_estimator` — no conflict.
- Repo: `jmbriccola/ha-irrigation-configurable`, MIT, copyright
  **Jacopo Maria Briccola** (LICENSE header updated from `jmbriccola`).

## Source system

`existing-scripts/{automations,scripts}.yaml` is the field-validated 2-zone
YAML system the spec generalises. Formulas cross-checked against it. Extra
details harvested from it (kept as engine behaviour):

- Lawn preset mm-target has a **floor of 3 mm** (`[..., 3] | max`) in addition
  to the 8 mm cap.
- "Rain today" at evaluation time = committed counter + staged hour × 0.8 when
  evaluating before minute 55 (pro-rata of the stage-and-commit slot).
- Counter caps: daily rain ≤ 200 mm, hourly staging ≤ 50 mm.
- Rounding contract (reproduces §8 exactly, verified by script 2026-07-17):
  weighted temp → 0.1 °C; credit/budget/threshold → 0.01 mm; durations →
  whole minutes via `round()`. §8 outputs reproduced: 31.0 °C, 0.09 mm,
  3.79 mm, 4.5 mm, water, 32 min, 15 min.
- YAML defaulted missing temp days to 25 °C; the spec supersedes this with
  weight renormalisation over available days (bootstrap) — implemented in the
  engine, YAML behaviour NOT carried over.

## Architecture decisions (full text: docs/design/architecture.md)

1. **Zones as config subentries** of a single hub entry (spec option a).
   Zone editing via subentry reconfigure flow (subentries have no options
   flow); zone reordering via `number` entity + `set_zone_order` service.
2. **Pure engine** in `engine/` (no HA imports, clock injected, frozen
   dataclasses): curves, weather model, scheduling/cadence/restrictions,
   session planner. Rounding contract above.
3. **Config vs state**: config in entry/subentries (numbers like order/
   interval/adjustment write back to subentry data); runtime state (temp/rain
   history keyed by ISO date — rotation-free, prune old keys; last-completed
   per zone; manual-stop ts; suspensions; consumption) in
   `helpers.storage.Store`. Update listeners apply config in place, no reload
   mid-cycle; running session keeps its frozen plan.
4. **Session model**: first trigger starts a session → ONE weather fetch →
   engine evaluates all due cycles → frozen SessionPlan; later triggers join
   the running session reusing the snapshot. Manual runs enter the same
   queue. Nothing opens a valve except the queue runner.
5. **Zone run state machine**: QUEUED → WAITING_FREE → SETTLING → OPENING →
   WATERING ⇄ SOAKING → CLOSING → COMPLETED, with SKIPPED / CANCELLED /
   INTERRUPTED exits. Watchdog + sentinel are independent of sessions.
   Master valve = managed valve, exempt from foreign-valve rule in-session.
6. **Card**: Lit 3 + TS + Vite in `card/`, bundle committed to
   `custom_components/irrigation_maestro/frontend/`, served via
   `async_register_static_paths`, auto-registered Lovelace resource (storage
   mode) with `?v=` cache-busting; reasons published as keys, localised in
   card and in sensor attributes.
7. Presets `preset_pots` / `preset_lawn` = §8 reference curves, shipped as
   read-only curve templates.

## Progress log

- 2026-07-17: Repo recon (LICENSE only + source YAML). §8 math verified by
  script. Domain collision check done (free). Architecture doc written.
  Dev env: uv + Python 3.13 venv; HA test framework installing.
